    <p> hi, my name is BakerKitty and I like to be with kittens and bake things.
       I also think I know what cats like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Eating food </li>
      <li> Playing with things that can roll around </li>
      <li> Sunbathing  </li>
      <li> Having catnip </li>
    </ul>

    <p> Things that I think cats don't like are. </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Water </li>
      <li> Having medicne </li>
      <li> Other cats unless they have been with each
        other basically there entire life. </li>
      <li> thunder </li>
   </ul>
